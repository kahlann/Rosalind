# Rosalind
Python scripts to solve Rosalind problem set (https://rosalind.info/problems/). 

In each directory, there is a python script that will solve the problem (*.py), an example problem set (rosalind_*.txt), and the corresponding solution (answer.txt). The scripts are set up such that when run from the command line, with the problem set in the same directory, the answer will be printed to the terminal. 
Example:

:~/Rosalind/1_CountNucleotides$ ls
CountNucleotides.py
rosalind_dna.txt

:~/Rosalind/1_CountNucleotides$ python3 CountNucleotides.py
